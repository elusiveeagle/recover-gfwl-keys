A simple PowerShell script that recovers product keys from previously activated *Games for Windows LIVE* titles.

## üîß What It Does
This script recovers product keys for previously activated Games for Windows LIVE (GFWL) titles by locating and decrypting each title‚Äôs activation data.

The script performs the following actions:
- Scans the default GFWL titles directory (or a user-specified root path)
- Identifies valid title-specific subdirectories containing `Token.bin` activation files
- Decrypts each product key using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)
- Validates the product key format and logs warnings for any decryption issues
- Outputs the recovered product keys alongside their corresponding title IDs and names

## üìã Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later (available by default on Windows 10 and newer)

## üí° Example Output

```
Recovered 2 GFWL product keys

Title ID  Product Key                    Title Name
--------  -----------                    ----------
4D5307D6  ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UVWXY  Shadowrun
4E4D0FA1  ZYXWV-UTSRQ-PONML-KJIHG-FEDCB  Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition
```

## üîç Notes & Troubleshooting

- Only product keys for GFWL titles activated under the **current Windows user account** can be recovered.
- If the script returns zero product keys, it likely means no GFWL titles were activated on this account.
- This script is able to identify the names of *most* GFWL titles. A future release will improve support.
- Use the `-Verbose` switch for diagnostics and scan details. See [Debugging](#-debugging).

## üöÄ Typical Usage

1. Sign in to the Windows user account originally used to activate your GFWL titles.

2. Download the script to a known location:  
   - üîç [View on GitHub](https://github.com/elusiveeagle/recover-gfwl-keys/blob/main/Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1)  
   - üì• [Download Raw .ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elusiveeagle/recover-gfwl-keys/refs/heads/main/Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1)

3. Open PowerShell:
   1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
   2. Type `powershell` and press **Enter**.

4. Run the script:
   Most systems restrict running downloaded scripts for safety. You can either:

   üîπ **Recommended (no system changes):** Temporarily bypass restrictions just for this PowerShell session:

   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1'
   ```

   üîπ **Advanced users only:** If you‚Äôve previously configured PowerShell to allow script execution (e.g., using `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`), you can run it directly:

   ```powershell
   & 'C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1'
   ```

   üí° *If you see an error like `running scripts is disabled on this system` or `The file C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1 is not digitally signed`, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit‚Äôs just your system being cautious. The first method above will safely bypass that.*

## üìö View Usage

Use the `-Help` switch to display parameters and usage:

One-time override:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& 'C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1' -Help"
```

Policy-enabled run:

```powershell
& 'C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1' -Help
```

## üß™ Debugging

Enable verbose output for diagnostics and scan details with the `-Verbose` switch:

One-time override:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& 'C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1' -Verbose"
```

Policy-enabled run:

```powershell
& 'C:\Path\To\Recover-GFWLKeys.ps1' -Verbose
```
